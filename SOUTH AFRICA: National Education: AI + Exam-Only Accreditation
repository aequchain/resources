## PART 7: COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

### Traditional vs AI-Learning + Exam-Only

| Level | Traditional Route | AI + Exam-Only | Time | Savings |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------|---------|
| **Matric (Private School)** | R50,000-R120,000/year (3 years) = R150,000-R360,000 | ASC FREE or SACAI R12,000 | 1-3 years | **92-97%** |
| **IEB Matric** | R60,000-R150,000/year = R180,000-R450,000 | IEB Exam R8,605 | 1-3 years | **95-98%** |
| **TVET NC(V)** | R15,000-R30,000 (3 years) | Similar (practical required) | 3 years | Minimal |
| **Bachelor's Degree (Residential)** | R40,000-R80,000/year × 3-4 years = R120,000-R320,000 + Accommodation R50,000/year = R270,000-R520,000 | UNISA R70,000-R100,000 total | 3-4 years | **62-81%** |
| **Honours (Residential)** | R50,000-R100,000 + Accommodation = R100,000-R180,000 | UNISA R25,000-R35,000 | 1 year | **65-81%** |
| **Masters (Residential)** | R60,000-R150,000/year × 2 = R120,000-R300,000 + Accommodation = R220,000-R460,000 | UNISA R30,000-R80,000 | 1-3 years | **63-83%** |

**Additional Hidden Costs Saved:**
- Accommodation: R50,000-R80,000/year
